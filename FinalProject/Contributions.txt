Documentation:
The UML Diagram was made by Sam and Chetachi. 
Sam made the CRC cards for Property, PaymentRecord, PropertyOwner, DepartmentManagementMenu, CommandLineRun, PropertyManagement and
ExitHandlerClass. Aoife made the CRC card for GuiRun, DepartmentGui and OwnerGui.
Each team member wrote the javadoc for their own methods as listed in implementation.
